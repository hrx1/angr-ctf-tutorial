# Angr CTF

**Derived (downloaded and modified significantly) from: https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf**

This repository contains all the files I needed to get basic understanding of how to use Angr. I've followed the material `materials/SymbolicExecution.pdf` and Angr documentation, and I've solved all Angr CTF examples from https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf whose solutions are also in this repository. Solutions in this repository are different from _jakespringer_ solutions because they are adjusted for (at the time) newer version of angr as of 15.6.2021., but the results are (mostly) the same.

Original workbook like tasks can be found in jakespringers repository in `XY_task_name/scaffoldXY` files like  https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf/blob/master/06_angr_symbolic_dynamic_memory/scaffold06.py

Directories in the root of this repo:
 - `bin` - contains binaries used in this CTF;
 - `materials` - contains PDF of presentation from which I've learned a lot;
 - `my_playground` - contains some examples I've come up with during my learning phase;
 - `my_solutions` - contains solutions I've come up with for angr on 15.6.2021.;
 - `official_solutions` - solutions found on `jakespringer` repo;
